### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bogdan Parshintsev from Russia, and I'm a python backend developer. I really enjoy learning programming and frameworks like aoihttp, flask. Also my work is writing apis, docs, tests, writing and optimizing SQL queries. Creading microservices for different tasks, like scheduled events, oauth, stats writing to clickhouse and etc. Working with async code on python and continuous integration.
